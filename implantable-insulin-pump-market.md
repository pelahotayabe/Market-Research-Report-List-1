<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implantable Insulin Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed-Loop Insulin Pump</li><li>Open-Loop Insulin Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The implantable insulin pump market primarily consists of two types: closed-loop and open-loop insulin pumps. Closed-loop insulin pumps, also known as automated insulin delivery systems, continuously monitor glucose levels and deliver insulin accordingly, providing a more precise insulin management solution. In contrast, open-loop insulin pumps require manual input from the user for insulin delivery, lacking real-time glucose monitoring. Both systems aim to enhance diabetes management, with closed-loop systems offering greater convenience and improved glycemic control for patients.</p></p>
