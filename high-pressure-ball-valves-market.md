<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Pressure Ball Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Remote Mounting</li><li>Direct Mounting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high pressure ball valves market can be categorized into two main types: remote mounting and direct mounting. Remote mounting allows the valve actuator to be positioned away from the valve body, facilitating easier access and reducing space constraints in confined areas. This is ideal for applications requiring frequent adjustments. In contrast, direct mounting connects the actuator directly to the valve, ensuring a more compact design with potentially quicker response times. Each type serves specific operational needs based on installation requirements and space availability.</p></p>
