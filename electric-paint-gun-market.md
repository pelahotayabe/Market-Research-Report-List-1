<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Paint Gun Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HVLP</li><li>LVLP</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric paint gun market primarily features two types: High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) and Low-Volume Low-Pressure (LVLP) guns. HVLP guns use a high volume of air at low pressure, providing a fine spray and minimizing overspray, making them suitable for detailed work and reducing paint waste. In contrast, LVLP guns operate at lower air volumes and pressures, offering better control for small projects and intricate designs. Both types cater to distinct applications, balancing efficiency, precision, and finish quality.</p></p>
