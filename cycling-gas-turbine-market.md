<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cycling Gas Turbine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop</li><li>Closed Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cycling gas turbine market is categorized into two primary types: open loop and closed loop systems. Open loop systems draw in ambient air for combustion, using it directly for power generation without recycling exhaust gases, making them simpler and often cheaper to operate. In contrast, closed loop systems recirculate exhaust gases back into the combustion process, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Both types are integral to optimizing energy production and managing environmental impacts in turbine operations.</p></p>
